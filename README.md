### Motivation

Managing university life isn’t as straightforward as it looks on paper. With deadlines spread across different platforms and little structure to guide study habits, it’s easy to lose track of tasks or fall behind. Despite wanting to stay organised, many students struggle to keep up. ProcrastiNUS was created to bring everything into one place, making it easier to manage academic life and build consistent, productive routines.

### Aim

Our aim is to create a mobile application tailored for NUS students that encourages consistent study habits, and fosters accountability through social and gamified features. By combining essential tools like task management, NUSMods calendar integration, and timer-based focus systems with a mascot-driven reward mechanic and social interaction (e.g., leaderboards, friends, and group features), we hope to provide a holistic productivity companion. The app is designed to reduce procrastination, increase motivation, and make academic productivity both structured and enjoyable.
